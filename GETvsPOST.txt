🔹 What is a Request?
In web development, when a client (like a browser) wants to communicate with a server, it sends an HTTP Request.
There are different types of requests, and the most commonly used are GET and POST.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ GET Request
A GET request is used to retrieve data from the server.

🔸 Characteristics:
1. Data is sent in the URL (as query parameters) (String Data).
Example: /search?query=Ramayana
2. It is visible in the address bar.
3. It is not secure for sending sensitive data.
4. Can be cached by the browser.
5. Has length limitations (URL size limit).
6. Used for reading data, not modifying anything.

🔸 Example in Express.js:
app.get('/search', (req, res) => {
    const { query } = req.query;
    res.send(`You searched for ${query}`);
});

✅ POST Request
A POST request is used to send data to the server, often to create or update something.

🔸 Characteristics:
1. Data is sent in the body of the request (not visible in the URL) (Any Type of Data).
2. Suitable for sensitive or large data.
3. Cannot be cached.
4. Has no length limitations.
5. Mostly used for form submissions, logins, etc.
6. Used for writing data.

🔸 Example in Express.js:
app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
    const { username, password } = req.body;
    res.send(`Logging in user: ${username}`);
});

⚠️ To use req.body, you need to use middleware:

app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(express.json());

WHY ??? - Why do we need express.urlencoded() and express.json() middleware to use req.body in a POST request?

🔍 The Real Reason:
🚧 By default, Express doesn't know how to parse the body of incoming requests.

When a POST request sends data (like from a form or a JSON payload), that data is placed in the body of the HTTP request — not in the URL.
But:
1. That body is just raw data (a stream of bytes).
2. Express won’t parse it automatically unless you tell it how to

🧰 Solution: Use Middleware
Middleware functions in Express sit in between the request and response.

Two special ones are:

✅ express.urlencoded({ extended: true })
1. Parses data sent by HTML forms (like <form method="POST">)
2. Converts it into a usable req.body object.
3. extended: true allows for nested objects.

✅ express.json()
1. Parses JSON data sent via tools like fetch(), Postman, or modern frontend apps (React, etc.).
2. Converts JSON into req.body.

🧪 Without Middlewares :
app.post('/submit', (req, res) => {
    console.log(req.body); // ❌ undefined
});

📦 Analogy:
Think of the request body as a sealed package delivered to your house.
Express receives the package but doesn’t open it by default.
You need to install a helper (middleware) to open it and extract the contents.
