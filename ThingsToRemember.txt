Library v/s Framework:

🔹 Library

JavaScript: Lodash, Axios
Python: NumPy, Pandas

Analogy: Like ordering food — you choose what you want.

🔹 Framework

Control: Framework controls the flow and calls your code.

Example:

JavaScript: React, Angular, Vue, Express.js
Python: Django, Flask

🔹 What is Express?
Express is a web framework for Node.js used to build web applications and APIs easily and quickly.

🔧 Key Features:
✅ Handles HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.)
✅ Helps build servers and routes
✅ Supports middleware (functions that run between the request and response)
✅ Simple and minimalist but powerful
✅ Widely used for REST APIs and backend services

(Four Basic Things of Express: 1. Request Listening, 2. HTTP Request Parsing, 3. Request Routing, 4. Sending Response accordingly)

Ports are just numbers (0–65535) used in networking to identify specific services or programs on a device.
They help your computer decide where to send incoming data and which program should handle it.

🔁 In Simple Words:
Ports are like numbered mailboxes inside your device.
Data comes with a port number, and your system delivers it to the right app or service using that number.


✅ What is Nodemon?
Nodemon is a utility that monitors for changes in your Node.js source code and automatically restarts the server. It's super useful during development.

🔧 Install Nodemon Globally (recommended for CLI use): npm install -g nodemon
This allows you to use nodemon from anywhere in your terminal.

🚀 Run with Nodemon Directly:
If installed globally: nodemon index.js
