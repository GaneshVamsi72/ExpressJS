🔹 What Are Middlewares in Express?
A middleware is a function that runs between the request coming from the client and the final response sent by the server.
-> Think of it like a checkpoint through which every request passes.

Formal Definition:-
Middleware functions are functions that have access to req, res, and next and can modify or handle the request before passing it forward.

📌 Middleware Function Structure
function middleware(req, res, next) {
    // Do something here
    next(); // pass control to next middleware or route
}

req → incoming request
res → outgoing response
next() → tells Express to move to the next middleware/route

🔥 Why Are Middlewares Used?
✔ Logging - Track which routes are being called.
✔ Authentication - Check if the user is logged in.
✔ Body Parsing - Convert JSON data into req.body.
✔ Validation - Ensure user inputs are correct.
✔ Error Handling - Catch errors and respond properly.
✔ Serving Static Files - Handle images/CSS/JS without writing routes.

app.use([path,] callback [, callback...]) -> Mounts the specified middleware function or functions at the specified path: the middleware function is executed when the base of the requested path matches path.

path -> Default: '/'
callback -> One or more callback functions. 
Accepted formats:
1. A single middleware function.
2. Multiple middleware functions separated by commas.
3. An array of middleware functions.
4. A combination of the above.

Middleware for Specific Routes:-
    const checkUser = (req, res, next) => {
        const user = false;
        if (!user) return res.send("Access Denied!");
        next();
    };

    app.use('/admin', checkUser);

⭐ Now any route starting with /admin will pass through checkUser.
